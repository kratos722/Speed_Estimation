# speed_estimation
This a project for our final year which will estimate the speed of a moving vehicle on a road integrated into a vehicle monitoring system
The project has been created using the files of pyimagesearch and modified according to our usage. 
The project is highly inspired from " Detection of 3D Bounding Boxes of Vehicles Using Perspective
Transformation for Accurate Speed Measurement " by Victor Kocur and Milan Ftacnik.
The two videos are from youtube itself.
To run the project:
python speed_estimation_dl.py -c "Full path to the directory"\speed_estimation\config\config.json -s " path to Video Source " .
